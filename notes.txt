At this point, I can use HPC to collect seed and candidate papers in parallel. One batch job will take a review article from WoS, find all the references, and generate five different seed/candidate splits (with five random seeds).
The previous analysis used MAG, and the results in the `jp_autoreview` MySQL database has MAG IDs for its review articles.
Next: collect all of the WoS IDs for the review articles we analyzed previously.
Used `collect_wos_review_ids.py` to collect 795 WoS IDs
